# About me ğŸ‘‹


**yoshiki634/yoshiki634** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning kotlin & python.
- ğŸ‘¯ I am shy.
- ğŸ’¬ I am new to programming.
     Help everyone!
- ğŸ˜„ Actually, English is not my strong point. If it were Japanese, I wouldn't have a problem.
